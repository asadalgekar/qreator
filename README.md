# Node.js and Express.js Power 💪
QReator utilizes Express.js, a versatile web application framework for Node.js. While QR code generation primarily happens on the client side using JavaScript libraries, Express.js plays a key role in serving the application, handling routes, and managing user interactions. It provides a structured environment for handling requests, allowing for seamless communication between the client and the server.

The benefits of Express.js extend beyond QR code generation. It simplifies server-side development, making it easier to manage routes, handle requests, and integrate middleware for tasks like validation and authentication. Although QR code generation itself is a client-side process, Express.js ensures a smooth user experience by efficiently serving the application and managing interactions.
